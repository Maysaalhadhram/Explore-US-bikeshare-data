- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

**The Chicago and New York** City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year


# Learning Outcomes

- Writing code to import the data. 
- Answer interesting questions about the data by computing descriptive statistics. 
- writing a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

# Installation instructions 

The data set of each cities {United States-Chicago, New York City, and Washington} are available in Kaggle through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohebmhanna/udacity-us-bikeshare-data
